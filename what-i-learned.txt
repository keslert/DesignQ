#Letter Spacing
- Every letter has spacing added to it, including the ending letter. It isn't just the space in between the letters. It's more like appending space to the end of a letter.
- Letter spacing is independent of font size and font family.
- The formula for letter spacing = num_of_characters * (letter_spacing_in_pixels) * .6635
- If you choose to use relative letter spacing (such as ems) just convert the letter spacing from relative t

- So.... scratch all that. Turns out the .6635 is actualy 1.0... or maybe I'm still missing something...
